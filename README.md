## Project Overview

Energy consumption prediction is a critical task for large-scale buildings and industries looking to minimize costs and improve efficiency. This project utilizes time-series data and various machine learning models to predict energy usage.

The dataset used includes information such as:
- Building characteristics
- Historical weather data
- Meter readings (electricity, steam, chilled water, etc.)

The **Great Energy Predictor** project aims to deliver accurate forecasts through advanced feature engineering and model tuning, supporting data-driven decision-making in energy management.

## Features

- **Data preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and feature engineering on the energy dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization of energy consumption trends and weather patterns.
- **Modeling**: Application of various machine learning models including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- **Evaluation**: Model performance evaluated using RMSE and MAE metrics.
- **Prediction**: Forecasting energy consumption for future dates based on historical data.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models and preprocessing
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting for model training
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment
