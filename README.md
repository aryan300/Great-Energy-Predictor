Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need the following tools installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Git
Setup
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/aryan300/Great-Energy-Predictor.git
cd Great-Energy-Predictor
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset from the Kaggle competition and place it in the data/ directory.
Usage
After installation, you can explore the notebooks for data analysis, feature engineering, and model building.

Open Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code

Navigate to the notebooks/ folder and open the relevant notebook for your analysis, such as data_exploration.ipynb or model_training.ipynb.

Run the cells to follow through with data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training steps.

Modeling Approach
The project employs a range of machine learning techniques to predict energy consumption. Key steps include:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and data normalization.
Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features from raw data, such as time-based features, weather interaction terms, etc.
Modeling: Various regression models are tested, including:
Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
Evaluation: Model performance is assessed using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R² score.
Results
The results of the project are summarized below:

Best Performing Model: (Specify the best model, e.g., XGBoost with fine-tuned hyperparameters)
RMSE on Test Data: X.xx
R² Score: X.xx
You can refer to the detailed evaluation in the notebooks/model_evaluation.ipynb file.
